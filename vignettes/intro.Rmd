This is where there will be an introduction to luajr.

TODO the table implementation of list isn't quite aligned with the vectors,
because there's no working analogy to 'newindex' (i.e. passing a list x into
a function with mode `'r'` and then doing `x[1] = "foo"` doesn't change the underlying
list, although doing `x[1][1] = "foo"` would.) Document this.

In general, that can be expressed as lists aren't ever really by reference, 
only their vector elements are by reference or by value.

TODO note that logical semantics don't make a huge amount of sense due to 
true/false/NA, so it is better to explicitly check.
