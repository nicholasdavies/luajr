luajit as subfolder in src/luajit
---------------------------------

I did this by using git subtree, explained here:

https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/the-power-of-git-subtree/

In particular, I added git aliases sba and sbu to ~/.gitconfig:

[alias]
    # the acronym stands for "subtree add"
    sba = "!f() { git subtree add --prefix $2 $1 ${3-master} --squash; }; f"
    # the acronym stands for "subtree update"
    sbu = "!f() { git subtree pull --prefix $2 $1 ${3-master} --squash; }; f"

(note that I added a configurable branch as arg 3)

then from the top-level luajr directory, added luajit as a subdirectory of src as follows:

git sba https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT.git src/luajit v2.1

to update the subdirectory (i.e. pull any updates to luajit), use:

git sbu https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT.git src/luajit v2.1

Warnings when making luajit
---------------------------

Having -march=native in CFLAGS causes a warning about an uninitialized fs.len
to be emitted when compiling ljamalg.o. Having looked at the offending source,
it's not a real issue.
