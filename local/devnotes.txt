Feature plan
------------
- Make sure all API functions can handle NAs, wrong types, etc.
- For luajr.list:
    v("/list/order", ord) -- reorder elements (like data.table)
- Make thread safe, perhaps by locking on any R operations from within Lua

- Mode where name suffix determines type, e.g. xs xb x1, or x_s, x_b, x_1? Or
a preprocessor with specified types? (meaning, can declare a lua func as
function(x:integer, y:numeric_r) etc)
- Once there is something to cite, usethis::use_citation()
- Do typedefs for underlying R logical, integer, numeric types?


luajit as subfolder in src/luajit
---------------------------------

I tried doing this with git subtree, explained here:

https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/the-power-of-git-subtree/

but ran into issues. Instead I now pull luajit to its own folder,
and copy everything except .git to luajr/src.

Use
   git show -s --format=%ct
in luaJIT directory to get timestamp of luajit, e.g. 1702296283

This should be put directly into ./src/luajit/.relver


Warnings when making luajit
---------------------------

Having -march=native in CFLAGS causes a warning about an uninitialized fs.len
to be emitted when compiling ljamalg.o. Having looked at the offending source,
it's not a real issue.
